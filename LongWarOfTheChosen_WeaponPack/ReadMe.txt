Long War WeaponPack for XCOM 2: War of the Chosen
By Pavonis Interactive 

This mod will add two new tiers of weapons, laser and coil, and a series of submachine gun-type weapons, one for each weapon tech level.

Laser weapons provide accuracy bonuses and coil weapons provide armor penetration bonuses. Laser weapons can be developed between conventional and magnetic weapons. Coil can be developed between magnetic and plasma weapons.

SMGs offer bonus mobility, concealment and close-range accuracy, at a penalty to damage and long-range accuracy relative to the assault rifle.

Configuration:
In XComLW_WeaponPack.ini, the setting USE_SCHEMATICS will control whether the laser and coil weapons will use the schematics system.
If set to true (the default), lasers and coil weapons will be placed as schematic upgrades between conventional and magnetic tiers and magnetic and beam(plasma), respectively, and techs will be ordered lasers-mag-coil-plasma. 
If false, lasers and coil weapons function as optional sidegrades to research and build. They are built individually and are never converted to other weapon techs.

The tech tree will also be altered depending on the setting.
